    "explanation": "To find 15% of 200, multiply 200 by 0.15. This gives us 200 × 0.15 = 30. You can also think of it as (15/100) × 200 = 30.",

    "explanation": "When you increase a number by 20% and then decrease it by 20%, the net result is a 4% decrease. This is because the 20% decrease is calculated on the increased value, not the original. Mathematically: If original = 100, after +20% = 120, after -20% of 120 = 96. Net change = -4%.",
